git-fs
======

git-fs lets you access the git filesystem as a normal filesystem.

Currently it lets you browse branches, reflogs, commits and worktrees.

When to use it
--------------

When you wonder what a file looks like in another branch, or a few versions
ago, or in a remote repository, you can call `git fs`, browse to the right
branch or reflog entry, and display the file.

To explore what a git repo looks like. For example, clone git.git, go to
.git/fs, and point a file browser to remotes/origin/todo/worktree/ .
Open remotes/origin/html/worktree/index.html in a web browser.

Building and using git-fs
-------------------------

Known dependencies:

    sudo aptitude install omake libfuse-dev libbatteries-ocaml-dev

Get ocamlfuse from source; ocamlfuse-2.7-1.tar.gz was used.

    wget http://downloads.sf.net/ocamlfuse/2.7/ocamlfuse-2.7-1.tar.gz
    sha256sum ocamlfuse-2.7-1.tar.gz
    c68eebae24a22ac5bd8394d3a5534b5411f10f9444f2d3bc8a8aabc40bb0e4be  ocamlfuse-2.7-1.tar.gz

Unpack ocamlfuse to a folder called (or symlinked) deps/ocamlfuse.

Build:

    make -C deps/ocamlfuse/lib
    omake

Usage:

    ./git-fs mount
    cd .git/fs/HEAD/worktree
    cat README
    cd -
    ./git-fs umount

Install (~/bin must be in your path):

    ln -s ~+/git-fs -t ~/bin

git-fs can now be invoked as:

    git fs mount

Or the shorter:

    git fs

Other features:

    git fs help
