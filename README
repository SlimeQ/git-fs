git-fs lets you access the git filesystem as a normal filesystem.

Currently it lets you browse branches, reflogs, commits and worktrees.

Known dependencies:

    sudo aptitude install omake libfuse-dev libbatteries-ocaml-dev

Get ocamlfuse from source; ocamlfuse-2.7-1.tar.gz was used.

Unpack ocamlfuse to a folder called (or symlinked) ocamlfuse.

Build:

    make -C ocamlfuse/lib
    omake

Usage:

    ./git-fs mount
    cd .git/fs/heads/master/worktree
    cat README
    cd -
    ./git-fs umount

Install (~/bin must be in your path):

    ln -s ~+/git-fs -t ~/bin

git-fs can now be invoked as:

    git fs mount

Or the shorter:

    git fs

Other features:

    git fs help
