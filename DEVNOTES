What OCaml fuse binding to use?

libfuse-ocaml uses fuse_lowlevel_ops, inode-based, rather than fuse_operations,
path-based. Inodes are created by fs_mknod, and info is mapped from inode
to a more complete structure.

ocamlfuse uses the highlevel ops. Inodes are managed by fuse (unless you pass
use_ino). All ops take a path, and some file ops have state passed around
via fuse's fh (filehandle). fh is created when returning from open or create.

HL/LL differences explained:
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.fuse.devel/3892

Both bindings require build fixes; libfuse-ocaml had a bogus META and other
stuff fixed. ocamlfuse isn't findlib-compatible. Let's see which are
upstreamed first.
libfuse-ocaml is LGPL3+ with linking exception.
ocamlfuse is GPL2=.
