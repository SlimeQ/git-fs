Map more stuff (tags: descriptions, tagger and signatures; reflog).
Elucidate the stat st_size stuff; fuse sounds like it relies on it.

Get a library to access the repo without fork/malloc/die cycles
that cost (in memory latency? whatever, it's very slow).
Also consider getting rid of the file-at-once requirement;
things like libmagic need much less.

There are a ton of perf tweaks we could do, but they are dwarfed by
the library stuff so I won't mention them.

== Done

Remove the base64 refnames hack.
Add a default mountpoint, and be singleton on that.
Simplest possible tag support.
Support symlinks inside the worktree.

Get rid of system(); abstractions backed by shit and it's unsafe. Go the exec route, not the autoquote everything crap.
This was done at the cost of some deep integration with Unix / BatUnix, unfortunately.
